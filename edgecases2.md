. Empty input
   - Empty array, string, or data structure
   - Null input

2. Single element input
   - Array or list with only one element
   - Tree with only a root node

3. Two element input
   - Especially for sorting or comparison algorithms

4. Maximum and minimum values
   - Integer overflow or underflow
   - Floating-point precision issues

5. Duplicate elements
   - All elements are the same
   - Some elements are repeated

6. Reversed or nearly reversed input
   - Sorted array in descending order when ascending is expected
   - Worst-case scenario for some sorting algorithms

7. Already sorted input
   - Best-case scenario for some sorting algorithms

8. Large input sizes
   - Test for time and space complexity
   - Potential stack overflow for recursive solutions

9. Small input sizes
   - Ensure the algorithm works correctly for minimal valid inputs

10. Negative numbers
    - Especially important for mathematical operations and array indices

11. Zero values
    - Division by zero
    - Zero as an element in arrays or as a node value

12. Floating-point numbers
    - Precision issues
    - Comparison of floating-point numbers

13. Character edge cases (for string problems)
    - Empty string
    - String with only spaces
    - Special characters and Unicode

14. Unbalanced data structures
    - Skewed binary trees
    - Unbalanced parentheses or brackets

15. Cyclic structures
    - Linked list with a cycle
    - Graphs with cycles

16. Disconnected components
    - Graph with multiple disconnected subgraphs

17. Boundary values
    - First and last elements of an array
    - Leftmost and rightmost nodes in a tree

18. Power of two values
    - Especially relevant for bitwise operations and certain divide-and-conquer algorithms

19. Prime numbers
    - Relevant for number theory problems

20. Alternating patterns
    - Arrays with alternating high and low values

21. Palindromic input
    - For string or array problems

22. Sparse data structures
    - Matrices with mostly zero elements
    - Graphs with few edges

23. Dense data structures
    - Fully connected graphs
    - Matrices with mostly non-zero elements

24. Inputs with different data types
    - Mixed integer and string arrays
    - Objects with various property types

25. Case sensitivity (for string problems)
    - All uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed case input

26. Whitespace handling
    - Leading, trailing, or excessive internal whitespace

27. Time-based edge cases (for time-related problems)
    - Leap years
    - Daylight saving time transitions
    - Date/time format variations

28. Language-specific edge cases
    - Unicode handling
    - Different character encodings

29. Platform-specific issues
    - Different integer sizes on 32-bit vs 64-bit systems
    - Endianness

30. Concurrency edge cases (for multi-threaded problems)
    - Race conditions
    - Deadlocks
