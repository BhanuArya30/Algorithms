### General Edge Cases
1. **Empty Inputs**
   - Empty array or list.
   - Empty string.
   - Null or None input values.

2. **Single Element Inputs**
   - Array or list with one element.
   - String with one character.

3. **Minimal and Maximal Sizes**
   - Arrays or lists with zero, one, or maximum allowed elements.
   - Trees with one node or deeply nested nodes.

4. **Duplicates**
   - Input arrays or lists with duplicate values.
   - Strings with repeated characters.

5. **Sorted and Reverse-Sorted Inputs**
   - Already sorted arrays or lists.
   - Reverse sorted arrays or lists.

6. **Uniform Inputs**
   - All elements in arrays or lists are the same.

7. **Negative and Positive Numbers**
   - Inputs with all negative, all positive, or a mix of both numbers.

8. **Boundary Values**
   - Minimum and maximum possible values (e.g., Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE).

9. **Off-by-One Errors**
   - Values just above or below critical thresholds.

10. **Time Constraints**
    - Consider cases that challenge the time complexity of your algorithm, especially with large datasets.

### Specific Data Structure Edge Cases

#### Arrays and Strings
- Subarrays or substrings at the start, middle, and end.
- Input arrays or strings of odd and even lengths.

#### Linked Lists
- Circular linked lists.
- Linked list with an odd or even number of elements.
- Operations at the head and tail (e.g., insertions and deletions).

#### Trees and Graphs
- Unbalanced trees (e.g., all nodes are to one side).
- Binary trees with only left or right children.
- Fully connected graphs versus sparsely connected graphs.
- Graphs with cycles and without cycles.
- Trees with duplicate values.

#### Stacks and Queues
- Operations on empty stacks or queues.
- Stacks and queues with only one element.

#### Heaps
- Min-heap and max-heap properties under various conditions.

#### Hash Tables
- Handling of collisions.
- Operations when the hash table is empty or full.

#### Recursion and Backtracking
- Maximum recursion depth.
- Inputs that maximize backtracking steps.

### Algorithm-Specific Edge Cases

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Sorted and reverse-sorted input.
- All elements being the same.

#### Searching Algorithms
- Element not present in the input.
- Element at the beginning, middle, or end.

#### Dynamic Programming
- Input cases that test the use of memoization or tabulation effectively.
- Smallest possible inputs to verify base cases.
